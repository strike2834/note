## 題目

給定一個整數 `n`，試求一包含 `n` 個字符的字符串，該字符串中每個字符出現的**次數為奇數**。

回傳的字符串必須只包含小寫英文字母。如果有多個有效的字符串，返回其中**任何**一個。

```jsx
Example 1:

Input: n = 4
Output: "pppz"
Explanation: "pppz" is a valid string since the character 'p' occurs three times and the character 'z' occurs once. Note that there are many other valid strings such as "ohhh" and "love".

Example 2:

Input: n = 2
Output: "xy"
Explanation: "xy" is a valid string since the characters 'x' and 'y' occur once. Note that there are many other valid strings such as "ag" and "ur".

Example 3:

Input: n = 7
Output: "holasss"
```

## 解法

```jsx
return n % 2 === 0 ? `${"a".repeat(n - 1)}b` : "a".repeat(n);
```
